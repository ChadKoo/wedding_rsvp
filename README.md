## About Me
Hello! 👋 I'm Chad, a developer in training studying at Moringa School. I specialize in front-end development using JavaScript, and I enjoy building projects that solve real-world problems and provide meaningful experiences for users.

I started working on the Wedding RSVP application as a passion project in school and to improve my coding skills. I wanted to create a platform where users can easily confirm and cancel reservations for upcoming weddings. This project has been a great learning experience and an opportunity to improve my skills in Javascript.

When I'm not coding, I enjoy exploring new technologies, playing video games, and watching movies.
