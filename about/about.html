            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>Hello! 👋 I'm Chad, a developer in training at Moringa School. I specialize in front-end development, particularly with JavaScript. I love building applications that provide useful solutions and enhance user experiences.</p>
            
            <h2>Why I Created This App</h2>
            <p>I created the Wedding RSVP application as part of my journey to improve my coding skills. The idea came from my interest in making wedding planning easier by offering a straightforward way for people to RSVP for events. The app allows users to submit their information, view others attending, and even cancel their reservation, all through a simple and user-friendly interface.</p>
            
            <h2>My Coding Journey</h2>
            <p>I’ve been learning programming through Moringa School, where I've gained experience with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I wanted to put these skills to the test by building something useful, and this app is a reflection of that. I’m always eager to learn new technologies and techniques to improve my work, and I love the process of turning ideas into functional applications.</p>
